# Introducing Hamazon.com (for all your example-app needs)

Hamazon, your Fine Purveyors of Pork Products since 2010, is an example app I use so as to have a consistent example whenever I tell stories. In the spirit of Convention Over Configuration, it&#8217;s helpful to have a go-to narrative rather than inventing a new example for every story. Because Hamazon bears striking similarities to a certain e-commerce site, most people grok it quickly, and because the default Pivotal Tracker Sample Project is an e-commerce site, it&#8217;s easy to quickly generate a new Hamazon backlog at any time.

## Hamazon v0.1 includes:

- Design assets, mockups, and that sort of thing in the /doc folder. This is where I get most of the value of Hamazon these days.</li>
- The rest of this repo is a <em>very</em> old Spree install that I modified for cosmetic purposes. I haven&#8217;t tried to run it in years. One of these days I may update it (if I ever need to).
 
## Personas

- Sam the Seller
- Blake the Buyer

It&#8217;s my hope that others will start using Hamazon and contribute back to it. Code contributions would be welcome, but even just using it spreads the benefits of Convention Over Configuration: it helps us eliminate trivial choices. Just have some Hamazon. You know you want to.
