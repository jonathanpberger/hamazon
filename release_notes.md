# 20160726 v0.6 Automagic Sample Data

The big feature this release is Automatic Sample Dataâ€”you can automatically populate the app with reasonable-looking data. This vastly speeds up the process of spinning up a Hamazon instance to use for samples and demos.

We've also improved debugging (added pry), cleaned up the documentation, and cleaned up some design (mostly logo and favicon).


## All commits
Update favicon.
Add instructions for running app.
Add pry.
Add `ruby-version` so old spree works.
Add hamazon logo to spree app.
